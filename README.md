   - Reward : +1 when collecting a yellow banana, and -1 when collecting a blue banana.

   - State Space : The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. 

   - Action Space :
    0 - move forward.
    1 - move backward.
    2 - turn left.
    3 - turn right.

   - Goal : Environment solved when getting an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
  


2. Getting Started

   - File list  : ① Navigation.ipynb ② dqn_agent.py ③ model.py ④ checkpoint.pth(saved model)



3. Instructions

   - Run the codes below '4. It's Your Turn!' in 'Navigation.ipynb'.
   - 'dqn_agent.py' and 'model.py' should be included in the same project with 'Navigation.ipynb'.
   - Experiment results of the trained model was already recorded in the notebook files.
